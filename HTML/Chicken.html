        <p>
            The Nigeria Christian Corpers Fellowship (NCCF) came into existence in fulfillment of
            a prophecy of a prophecy given some years ago by Pa S.C. Elton, a notable British Missionary.
            The prophecy sounded like this “A time will come when the Nigeria Government would be paying the Nigeria
            Youth
            to preach
            the Gospel in all works and crannies of the country.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sounds far-fetched? Well, this page you are reading proves that the prophecy is already being
            fulfilled. The prophecy has been fulfilled since 1973.

            In 1983 NCCF came into existence. In NCCF we call ourselves “Jesus Corpers” and we have a slogan which is:
            Jesus
            Corpers/NCCF will never die
            – one big family. NCCF has her <a href="about.html">national</a> headquarter in Jos, Plateau state. NCCF is

                By faith, and faith alone,
