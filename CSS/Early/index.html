    <h1>The Header</h1>

        <h2>The Subheader</h2>
        <p>
            As the prices of the items are not fixed, the <a href="#nowhere">hawkers</a> as well as the buyers do
            bargain.
            I watch these people who feel greatly satisfied after purchasing
            a thing at a minimum price from the hawkers.
            The market is at peak in the evening. There is not a single shop where a big crowd is not seen.
            Everyone seems to be in hurry. There are jewellery shops which shine brightly in the light.
            Cloth shops and ready-made garment shops do great business during a festival.
        <p>
            The hotels and restaurants are also crowded with people.
            Some people are seen with plates of ‘chat’ others are seen enjoying cold drinks.
            There is flavour of all kinds in the surrounding area. It is very difficult to drive a car in a market
            place.
            What to talk of a car or a motorcycle sometimes it becomes difficult even to walk.
            On the occasion of festivals like Diwali, Dussehra and Holi the situation becomes worse.
            It seems all the population of the country is on the road. There is great hustle and bustle.
            In between the cars and motorcycles, we see those carrying different articles for sale.
            They create great problems as sometimes they bring the traffic at a halt resulting in loud horns from the
            car-drivers.
